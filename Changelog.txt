90.6.50:
-Updated CEF to 90.6.50.
-Added Multiple Tab Support.
-You Don't have to use the shortcut
anymore, because I Added a batch file
to change the user agent. Just click on
startgreenium.bat and the browser will
start with the changed user agent.
- Moved The Back, Forward, Refresh, Go buttons and the Address Bar to the
Bottom of the window.
